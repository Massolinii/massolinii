          Greetings! My name is Massimiliano, a 24-year-old who transitioned
          from biochemistry to web development.
          <br />
          <br />
          I have always been mesmerized by the transformative power of the
          internet, capable of ranging from simple everyday tools to solutions
          for intricate problems. This fascination ignited my journey into
          studying full-stack programming.
          <br />
          <br />
          My enthusiasm lies in crafting user-friendly, intuitive applications
          designed to address real-world issues. My current aim is to refine my
          skills as a full-stack programmer, ready to embrace new challenges,
          and contribute towards teamwork solutions.
